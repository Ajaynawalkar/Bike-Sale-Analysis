# Bike Sale Analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis on Bike Sale and Plot Visualization.
- Data Cleaning Process and Dashboard Creation in Jupyter Notebook and PowerBi ,In this project, we'll be analyzing a dataset and then communicate findings about it. we'll be using Python Language to Clean data and form the tables.
## Python Libraries used in project:
  - NUMPY
  - PANDAS
  - MATPLOTLIB
  - SEABORN
## CONTENT:
- 1)Introduction to Data : The dataset contains 1,13,036 records distrbuted in 18 columns.
- 2)Null Value and Reduction : There is 87054 Null Values in the "Frame Size" features, So to treating the Null Values we drop this Feature.
- 3)Statistical Information : Correlation, Covariance, & Standard Deviation.
- 4)Statistical Figures : Mean, Median and Mode.
- 5)Category Counting : Counting the Values (Product, Product Category, Sub Category)
- 6)Pivot Tables : In the Pivot Table Shows the Genderwise sales profit in dataset & category wise products order quantity in the categorical manner.
- 7)Cross Tabs : It helps us to make informed decisions regarding your research by identifying patterns, trends, and the correlation between your study parameters.
- 8)Strip Plot : A strip plot is very simple to understand. It is basically a scatter plot that differentiates different categories.
- 9)Line Plot : Line Plots depict the relationship between continuous as well as categorical values in a continuous data point format.
- 10)Categorical Plot[Catplot] : In the plot it shows the product categorical wise profit in the catplot and there is two outlier occurs in the given dataset.
- 11)Heat Map : Heat Maps is to better visualize the volume of locations/events within a dataset and assist in directing viewers towards areas on data visualizations that matter most.
- 12)Box Plot : A bar chart or bar graph is a chart or graph that presents categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent
- 13)KDE Plot : Kdeplot is a Kernel Distribution Estimation Plot which depicts the probability density function of the continuous or non-parametric data variables
- 14)Pie Plot : Pie chart show the distribution of the product category.
- 15)Product Analysis According to thier Category
### 16)Conclusion:
#### Products :
       - Sales decline from 2015 to 2016.
       - Since the rise of accessories in 2013 there is an inverse relationship with bikes.
       - The decline in Sales in 2016 was due to lower demand for bikes especially mountain bikes and 
         road bikes,There's a big drop in the U.S. and Australia.
       - Most of them are female, specifically in the 25-to 34-year-old age group.
#### Valuations :
       - Total Revenue of All Product Category is 85 Million.
       - United State Highest Revenue of 28 Million.
       - In Category Bike has the highest Revenue of 62 Million.
       - Count of Coustomer is 8000.
       - Total Transaction in number is 113K.
